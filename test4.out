 NOTE    35127: You are running a sequential version of Altair Feko, but it was detected that your machine has more than one core. For best performance, it would be recommended to run the parallel Feko Solver
 NOTE    35179: Compatible graphics card (GPU) found on this machine for possible hardware acceleration (your Feko license allows GPU usage). Please use the command line option --use-gpu to use or enable the checkbox in the GUI

                    Linear segments are used

          Length of the segments in m:         1.19917E-02

 The segment number 1 has neither a node nor a connection
 point. The segment cannot be taken into consideration.
 The parameter R1 in the EG card should possibly be changed.
 ERROR     180: A segment has neither a node nor a connection point
